# 🧠 Predictive Imputation on Parquet Data — CMPE301 Assignment

This notebook demonstrates a machine learning pipeline to clean and fill missing values in a `.parquet` dataset. The task involves replacing all `-100` values in **column G** with predictions generated by a trained regression model.

> 📂 **File provided:** `modified.parquet`  
> 🧪 **Goal:** Predict missing values (-100) using regression  
> 💾 **Output:** Cleaned `.parquet` file with predictions, named after your student ID

## 🚀 Project Overview

- ✅ Load and inspect a `.parquet` dataset
- 🧹 Identify and isolate `-100` values in column G as placeholders for missing data
- 📈 Train a regression model (likely using linear regression or similar) based on the other features
- 🔁 Replace missing values in column G with predictions
- 💾 Save the updated dataset as a new `.parquet` file named `122200044.parquet`

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** – for building the regression model
- **PyArrow / FastParquet** – for reading/writing parquet files
- **Google Colab** – as the runtime environment

## 🧠 Model Logic

The regression model was trained to predict missing entries by:
- Dropping rows with `-100` in column G
- Using the rest of the dataset as features (`X`) and column G as the target (`y`)
- Predicting missing entries using this trained model
- Replacing only the `-100` values with the predicted ones, keeping the rest of the structure intact
